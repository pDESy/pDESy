pDESy: Discrete-Event Simulator in Python
==========================================

pDESy is a Python package of Discrete-Event Simulator (DES).
It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world engineering project management by using DES and other DES modeling tools.
pDESy has only the function of discrete-event simulation, does not include the function of visual modeling.

Install
--------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pDESy
   # pip install git+https://git@github.com/pDESy/pDESy.git # INSTALL FROM GITHUB


How to use pDESy?
------------------

Example code of pDESy is `here <https://gist.github.com/taiga4112/278629844a14f7a61aa48763e3ceaa19>`_ .

If you want to implement more complex models for describling a real engineering project, you can create new model by inheriting base models.
